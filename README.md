_PAC Contributions_

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions and employee compensation across various sectors in San Diego County. Key highlights include:

Data Compilation: We compiled a dataset that encompasses contributions for multiple unions, including fire, engineering, police, sheriff, and teaching personnel.
Statistical Analysis: We performed regression analysis to evaluate the impact of PAC contributions on employee wages. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship, highlighting the influence of PAC funding on compensation structures.


_K12 Analysis_

Using the K12 public employee dataset, we investigated the wage dynamics of employees who changed jobs between districts compared to those who remained in the same position. Our findings revealed:

Wage Differences: The analysis showed a statistically significant difference in wages between employees who switched jobs and those who stayed within the same district.
Distribution Patterns: We observed that the distribution of wages for employees who switched jobs was skewed to the left, whereas the distribution for those who remained was more centrally concentrated.
